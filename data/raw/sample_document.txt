Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

Key Applications

NLP has numerous applications in today's world. Some of the most common include:

1. Machine Translation: Systems like Google Translate use NLP to translate text between languages.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Companies analyze customer reviews and social media posts to understand public opinion.
3. Chatbots: Virtual assistants use NLP to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.
4. Text Summarization: NLP can automatically generate summaries of long documents.
5. Named Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying entities like people, organizations, and locations in text.

Core Techniques

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual words or tokens. This is often the first step in NLP pipelines.

Part-of-speech tagging assigns grammatical categories to each word, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

Syntactic parsing analyzes the grammatical structure of sentences to understand relationships between words.

Semantic analysis goes beyond syntax to understand the meaning of text, including word sense disambiguation and semantic role labeling.

Modern Approaches

Recent advances in NLP have been driven by deep learning and transformer architectures. Models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have achieved state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks.

These models are typically pre-trained on large text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, making them highly versatile.

Vector embeddings represent words or sentences as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships. Words with similar meanings are located close together in this embedding space.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with language generation, allowing models to answer questions using external knowledge sources.
